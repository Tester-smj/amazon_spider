The older model is a heavy, durable plastic and the noise level is perfect as white noise. This new model feels cheap, and it barely makes any sound. Level 3 on this one makes as much white noise as level 1 on the older model. I'm very disappointed in this change from Honeywell. There was a time when they made the perfect fan. I'm going to take my old one to an electrician to see if it can be fixed.

The \"whole room air circulation\" claim seems like a load of marketing fluff, but I suppose if you work out the airflow in your room and aim the fan precisely you can achieve such air circulation nirvana. For most consumers, though, I would imagine you just want this thing to blow cool air when you're sweating out hot summers, and this fan does a decent job. The way it pushes air is that it pushes it out in a wide angle, so if you just point the fan at you you're likely not going to feel as good a breeze if you just use this to try and push the hot air around you away, Unfortunately, like others have stated the build quality of this fan is pretty sketchy, as my fan broke off from the base very easily within a year of normal use. So even if you think you have the most gentile of touches, I recommend just finding the perfect spot for this fan and then rarely if ever trying to move it lest you want to accidentally break it off of the base."},

HA! The teeny-tiny screws are located in narrow deep wells, so I am going to have to find a long and very small phillips screwdriver. Or just replace the thing when it gets dirty, which is not an ideal solution. The angle of the fan is adjustable and clicks into fixed positions on the stand. So far, I have not managed to turn it on without pushing it through all the angle stops. You need two hands to hold it in place and another to turn on the switch. (I only have two.) I bet the plastic will wear out quickly. The knob is awkward to grip and the first speed is high, so if you want low or medium, you have to click it one or two more stops. That seems counterintuitive to me and like unnecessary wear. The fan does the job and the materials seem sturdy, but the design is a bit strange."},

I have been buying these fans since the late 90's because they were an excellent value with air flow at a low price, but the quality seems to have dropped over the years.  In comparison, I had a no-name brand fan that I bought for under $10 at Home Depot and it lasted over three years before it went.  This fan was it's replacement but just didn't last.

I read the reviews and understood some of the issues other people had and was not too concerned about it tipping over, noise, or airflow. I purchased this fan to put in the window above our bed to give us a direct breeze at night. I used stationary square fans before and have to prop them up at the rear to get them to blow air down onto the bed. We were really looking forward to this fan that we could stabilize in the window and blow air on us. PROBLEM... the fan only rotates upward not downward... this totally defeats the use we purchased it for. When I have time I will see if I can remove the molded in factory stops so it can rotate down and be used as I intended."},

Mounted next to bathroom window. Hoping swivel would allow directing fan out window (exhaust smells) and then towards shower (eliminate mold). Product arrived as described. Product does not have mounting hardware (I drilled holes in base and used own mounting screws/materials). Product only swivels  90 degrees. Since I needed more, I carefully bent/forced the swivel limit closer to 180 degrees. The plastic did not rupture or break but I'm sure it stressed under the force. I now can swivel almost 180 degrees and still seems stable. Fan does not seem as powerful as a smaller -similar style (UtiliTech) fan I have mounted next to a vent-less gas heater (air circulation). Fan is quiet (do to low power) and I estimate about half as loud as a ground-standing standard square box fan (but half the power). Fan is entirely plastic including hinges and base. Pooped and showered this morning and it exhausted the smells and dried the shower."},

It started making a weird chirping sound, which was quite annoying, so I turned it off, then later went to turn it back on and it won't come on at all. I expected it to last much longer than that. There is a 1 year \"limited\" warranty, but you have to pay shipping charges ($10!), which is not acceptable considering I did nothing to damage the fan and a new unit would only cost $15. So. Yeah. I'm very irritated and disappointed in the fan and in Honeywell in general. I will replace it with another brand."},

After two months of continuous use, there was a horrific oder in the baby's room that smelled like burning electrical wires.  After spending a few weeks performing various troubleshooting activities such as moving out the cloth diaper pail and replacing the electrical outlets in the room, I was convinced there was a dead animal frying in the wiring somewhere within the walls.  I decided to unplug everything in the room (again) and I finally pulled out the fan and noticed the motor itself was the source of a substantial electrical smell.  I plugged the fan into a small bathroom thinking maybe the outlet was to blame and sure enough within 5 minutes the bathroom had the same burning electrical smell.  I have no idea why the white version of the same fan has this problem, but the black fan has been back in the baby's room operating 24/7 with no problems for months."},

I then went to the amazon page and saw that that specific model was no longer being made but the upgrade, the HT-900 was the new replacement so without delay I went ahead and bought two October of last year. A little less than a month later the first fan gave out. I wrote to the company which was called Helen of Troy and they took their time in answering. After explaining what had happened they told me to return the fan through the  ail and they would replace it. When I got to the post office I was told that the shipping would cost just as much as buying a brand new fan. So either I could buy a new fan or mail them the bad one, wait a couple of weeks for them process it and then send me a new one which may or may not work.

The fan is great in the fact that for the size it moves a good amount of air and the newer models are pretty quiet even on full.  I have a bulldog that loves to go lay in front of the fan when she is hot so this is the perfect size to suit her needs and I generally leave it running most of the summer season.  With how much I like how well this fan performs the glaring issue I have with them is longevity.  I have been using this model of fan for years but the problem is I pretty much have to buy a new one every year.  As they age the fan does get louder and eventually wont have enough power to start spinning on its own but will start moving if you were to stick something through the grates and poke the blades.  I have a feeling if it were possible to take the front off and clean the blades it may last longer."},

It is slightly bigger than a standard soccer ball. it looks big, but its maximum wind speed does not match to its size. The kind of breeze that hits your face while travelling at 10-15 miles per hour in a car hits you at its maximum speed. I have seen even smaller fan with powerful motor giving better breeze than this fan. I can bet that a normal hair dryer can give you stronger breeze (if we ignore area). When I turned it ON, I was slightly disappointed, but I think in this price it is a decent deal. if you are sweating it can dry you in 15 to 20 mins. Best part is that you won't get headache or fall sick because of direct breeze on your face at this speed. It is quite silent because it is slow. Also, IT DOES NOT TURN 360 degree (just straight and top - 90 degree angle of rotation is allowed). I just bought it because honeywell is a trusted brand, and lot of people already bought it and have given good reviews. I hope it will accompany me for at least 2-3 years. Last, if you are thinking of buying it for your office desk, then I would suggest you to buy a smaller one. It will occupy lot of space on your desk and won't look good. Expectations about speed may vary from person to person; to me it is 10 to 20% slow, which is not a huge disappointment overall. Honeywell can make it perfect by improving speed little bit and increasing range of angle of tilt by -40 to 90 (currently it is 0 to 90) degrees."},

Sure it circulates the air, but when you think of a TurboForce Air Circulator you get the impression by the description that you will get a huge rush of air that will flap the curtains and blow papers everywhere. That will never happen with a blade 3.5 inches long from the tip of the blade to the hub nor will it create a huge force of air with the blade angles and the rpm in which the fan turns.

I was very disappointed, especially considering the price. I have a fan that I bought for 9.99 that is louder, and not as well made. It's a metal fan, but it generates much more air, and I usually keep it on medium because high is too strong. I needed another fan, and this got such great reviews. If you want a fan you are going to keep right on top of you, this is fine, on the highest speed. I think it's better to buy a fan in person where you can feel how much air it will blow. My son just walked by it for the first time, and put his hand in front of it. His comment was 'unacceptable'. That says it - in a nutshell."},

This tiny fan is a great bargain IF you live in a small apartment like I do. It works well at all speeds but it needs to be directed right at you, and at short distances only. Even the fastest speed hardly created any air movement when I moved 8 feet from the fan. As for circulating air, it's okay, but definitely not enough when it's a hot stifling day. I would recommend this in addition to another fan/AC in the room, or if you sleep with it pointed at you from a nearby desk. It does not oscillate, so do not expect it to circulate air too well.

I was reading someones review and he was talking about how it was good for circulating air. That may be true, as it doesnt seem very \"turbo\" at all, but strangely i did notice it blowing my curtains which were 10 feet away. However this fan does not make me nor the air in my apartment feel the slightest bit cooler. It blows warm air around. I tried putting it in front of my window ac unit, thinking it would pull that cool air and distribute it, nope. Did nothing. I tried putting nxt to my open window to help feel cool air, nothing. I tried it by itself, just on my counter 3 feet away, didnt feel the slightest bit cooler. Maybe theres some magical secret that everyone else knows about how to make this thing work good, because I sure as hell dont. Complete disappointment for me. I gotta return it and try something else."},

It's a metal fan, but it generates much more air, and I usually keep it on medium because high is too strong. I needed another fan, and this got such great reviews. If you want a fan you are going to keep right on top of you, this is fine, on the highest speed. I think it's better to buy a fan in person where you can feel how much air it will blow.

Even the fastest speed hardly created any air movement when I moved 8 feet from the fan. As for circulating air, it's okay, but definitely not enough when it's a hot stifling day. I would recommend this in addition to another fan/AC in the room, or if you sleep with it pointed at you from a nearby desk. It does not oscillate, so do not expect it to circulate air too well.

Much to my chagrin, when it arrived, it is apparent the fan is better suited to a desk or table than a floor. Also, the reason for the fan is my neighbor's bastard Pomeranian, whose incessant barking sounds someone scuffing their shoe on a wood floor over and over for hours on end (rent-control makes moving out less attractive).... Thus, the mighty box fan, and voila! cessation of migraine. This fan is nearly silent. Great product, no doubt! -- but not well suited to my purposes."},

I was reading someones review and he was talking about how it was good for circulating air. That may be true, as it doesnt seem very \"turbo\" at all, but strangely i did notice it blowing my curtains which were 10 feet away. However this fan does not make me nor the air in my apartment feel the slightest bit cooler. It blows warm air around. I tried putting it in front of my window ac unit, thinking it would pull that cool air and distribute it, nope. Did nothing. I tried putting nxt to my open window to help feel cool air, nothing. I tried it by itself, just on my counter 3 feet away, didnt feel the slightest bit cooler. Maybe theres some magical secret that everyone else knows about how to make this thing work good, because I sure as hell dont. Complete disappointment for me. I gotta return it and try something else."},

I decided to try another station, and got the very same station.  So I asked my husband to try, thinking that maybe I wasn't speaking clearly enough for Alexa, but he got the very same station time and time again.  Tried to use the Tune In help on the app, but found \"this app is not supported\" when I tried.  I returned the Echo in less than a week of purchase as it was obviously not going to do what I needed it to do.  Found very little use for it otherwise.  Yes, Alexa gave me the weather report, but Siri on my ipod will do that.  Yes, it did have amazing sound playing from my Amazon library of items previously purchased, but the few uses I found did not justify the cost."},

It refers me to Echo feedback or the app when I ask it how to set up something on it. Really? You cannot even tell me how to use you? Can't even search for a feature or skill on Echo. I am highly disappointed in the lack of features. As my husband said, it's basically a clock radio that talks and oh yeah, shops Amazon when you ask for a price. It does play music, but so does my phone, my tablet & my TV & I have speakers. This morning I told Alexa she was stupid because she couldn't set up recurring reminders or answer any of my questions; her reply, \"Sorry, thanks for letting me know.\"  I'm sorry, too, Alexa--you need a serious upgrade. Life is stressful enough w/out the aggravation of hearing \"Sorry, I don't know\" all the time.

I'm a senior IT leader where I am employed so I'm very qualified to offer this opinion. I chatted with Echo support technicians, yes plural, who could not help. My chat connection dropped multiple times. Back to set up, I followed all instructions and even performed multiple factory resets.  Interestingly enough I chose to use my iPhone hotspot as the WiFi router and it worked. But that's obviously not an acceptable solution. This tells me that Echo doesn't like something about my router, which works perfectly with all of my devices including my Fire TV Box. I have significant doubts that the new Echo being sent to me will work but I'll try to get it to work. One thing for sure is that I won't spend lots of time on it if it doesn't work the first time. I already spent too many hours on the first one."},

It was portable and the kids had a real kick so we jumped when the deals day came around. We like the music, reminder, timer, and weather feature but the rest is so-so. I'm sure we'll use more of it as we get use to it. Our biggest issue is portability, it can only go as far as the wire goes. We like music around the pool but it needs an electrical outlet.  As a result, the echo sits in a corner in the house. There is a battery pack that can be attached to the echo, BUT it's another $50 investment. I'm searching for a more reasonably priced battery pack but I wouldn't have ordered had I known."},

I already have one of those, and it works much better, in a Siri device. I was curious to see how this device is going to work so I was glad to only pay half the normal price and at that I feel I payed too much.  The device has a very difficult time regardless of what they say understanding you from across the room with any type of background noise whatsoever. Even something as simple as a fan can wash out the capability for it to listen to you let alone if you're playing music or anything else over the device. As it stands right now I cannot recommend this device. I hope to update that in the future I plan to keep it and keep working with it, but hopes are not very high."},

You would really need a house full of SMARTS to use this to its full potential. If you don't, you might find yourself bored with it. I have a Nest thermostat, wemo switch and ooma. Those do work fairly well but I find myself using more of my phone apps to make adjustments more than using Alexa. My daughter uses it to help her spell words when we're not close by. In order to use Echo you need to download the app and sign in or create an Amazon account. Then download your desired SKILLS (basically apps) in order to get certain use out of it. Otherwise, Alexa doesn't know a whole lot. Apps are pretty limited too from what I've seen so far and many are limited to what they can do. Sometimes, it doesn't pick up my voice/command even when I'm just several feet from it. But when it does, it does a pretty good job at distinguishing your voice from background noise and voices. It'll pick up whatever I'm saying even when my TV is playing at louder volumes which I find pretty impressive. The speaker itself is pretty good but not great for certain music. Not balanced at all. My UE Boom sounds way better. Bass is almost non existent at higher volumes so if you like songs with bass, don't keep your hopes up. If you have a for example an iPhone and plan on having it play music from your music app, you can control it with Alexa via Bluetooth. But if you ask to play certain songs or artists, it will play from the Prime Music if you have it."},

I am using this device as a novelty and I waited all these years to get one because it was pulled along with my move to the Internet of Things (IoT).  I am adopting the IoT to allow me to better run AirBnB, and for that reason I need to automate lights, locks, and doors.  There is a steep learning curve, I ordered the Amazon Echo because all these things I wanted to get for my \"Smart\" home said Alexa compatible.  I had some dream that I could just talk to the Echo and have Alexa do all the heavy lifting.  The primary driver for this and not an app was so that other people in my household could also scream at the Echo and have Alexa do my chores for me.  I changed from talk to scream because if I talk in a normal voice the Echo misses as often as it hits (hears).  I am a bit hoarse as I write this from recently having screamed at my Echo a lot while on a tech support call.  I primarily wanted Alexa to do 3 things - 1) unlock the dead bolt in the front door, 2) turn lights outside front door on and off, and 3) use as a two way device to talk with people at my front door (via Ring or other similar doorbell).  1) Alexa will not unlock my deadbolt in the front door.  Alexa will only lock the deadbolt in the front door if it is named \"front door\" or has the word \"lock\" after another name.  For example \"Alexa, lock <dead bolt>\" doesn't work.  If you rename <dead bolt> to <dead bolt lock> then \"Alexa, lock <dead bolt lock>\" will lock your dead bolt.  I even tried \"Alexa lock <poo donkey lock>\" and that worked.  But if you say \"Alexa, lock <poo donkey>\" then Alexa tells you how to ask questions about donkeys.  I use <> to denote the literal name of the device as assigned to my Wink Hub 2, and all the names given appear verbatim in the discovered devices under smart home.  2) The light switch controls haven't arrived yet, so we will see.  Finally the two way device to talk with people at my front door: fail, but not Alexa's fault.  The video doorbells all use WiFi and don't have this level of advertised compatibility.  Final score 1) Fail, 2) N/A, 3) Fail because N/A.  I gave this 3 out of 5 stars because it recognizes most things I say even if Alexa has no idea what to do once it knows what I said.  I also gave it 3 out of 5 because I only have to scream half the time.  If you set music to 10 then good luck getting the microphone to work - even if you stand right over the echo.  I really think the technology isn't there yet but if you are an early adopter you can get some satisfaction from it.  If you wanted to have a hands free life of technological wizardy - keep dreaming."},

The games available for alexa are not nearly as entertaining as the one provided by the google home. The vaunted recipe use that is shown in the advertisements have terrible reviews.

The headline is that you should be weary of buying Amazon products through your Echo!  More on that below.  So far I've set up my Echo and experimented with its abilities and \"Skills\".  Skills are mini-apps that are written by third parties to give the Echo some special ability not built-in to the product.  I've only scratched the surface of the constantly growing universe of skills, but at this point I am dizzy from trying to remember what command I must utter to invoke specific skills.  For instance, the Echo can natively play almost any podcast under the sun, but native operation is disapointingly lacking.  The skill called AnyPod does add the ability to fast forward or rewind by X seconds or Minutes which is lacking in the Echo native podcast ability, but I now must remember to utter... \"Alexa, ask AnyPod to rewind 10 Seconds\".  The same extra invocations are necessary for many skills i.e. \"Alexa, ask Fidelity for stock prices\" etc.  I also own a Google Home, the competitor to Amazon's Echo and these requests are handled much more intuitively through the Google Home device."},

I use it for a timer and alarm clock. Alexa voice recognition is excellent, though it isn't clever like SIRI. If you insult Alexa it responds as if it doesn't understand, so it's not as entertaining as SIRI.  I got Echo for a gift so it was free. I wouldn't buy one, because for me it has a very limited use. I am not an Amazon prime member or have pay music services, so I can't really control music with it and I don't buy music by the song. It will start and stop the music I have stored from CDs as a collection, but Alexa can't find albums or individual songs I've stored. SIRI is better at finding things. Since I have different brand internet switches(pre-Echo) it is not compatible with them, so I can't control them. Since I have an app on my iPhone, SIRi can control these switches. There is no way to make Echo compatible, other than rebuy the switch. Since I use these switches to control my whole home music system it might be worth it to rebuy, but not now.. Someday when there are lots of things with compatible control capabilities integrated, Echo could be pretty good, but I imagine it will be quite expensive to convert to compatible devices. Right now to me it's not worth it. Stressing the product works very well, but to me it's a solution looking for a problem. Also you must be careful what you say. If you say, \"Alexa\" in any manner it comes on and is listening for a command. You can shut that off, but you then are totally defeating the purpose of the device."},

I can't sync my Iphone calendar with Alexa.  I can't even verbally add events to my  calendar very well; she doesn't understand me very well.  I asked Alexa to remind me at 4:00 p.m. to ask my daughter a question and I got no such reminder.  I can verbally add things to my to do lists but I can't verbally delete anything from my to do list.  She refers me to the Echo App.  The only four things so far that Alexa is doing well is 1) she gives me the weather 2) she plays music that is free through Amazon Prime, and 3) she reads books that I purchased in the past through audible, and 4) I've verbally ordered from Amazon.  Be carefully, Alexa will costs you more money!  It's tricky ordering things from Alexa because you are not seeing what you are ordering (so unless you've ordered something before be careful).  Also -- I ordered the ECHO on Prime Day and I mistakenly ordered a black ECHO and I meant to order a white one.  Without paying to send the echo back, there was no way for me to get the black echo replaced for a white one.  In fact  when I was chatting online with an Amazon  customer service person, they disconnected me when I  explained my problem.  I wanted to exchange it for a white echo.  They wouldn't even let me explain that i would have been willing to pay the postage; I just wanted to keep the 'sales' price."},

My home Wifi is fast and solid, so it's not losing a connection there.  Anyone else having this issue?"},

I enjoyed playing Jeopardy, but on the latest round, Alexa stopped in the middle of the questions. If I turn the volume up, at a certain point, she can't hear me, when I give voice commands, so I have to walk over, to turn her down.

For having been for sale as long as it has (the Echo), and for Alexa to have been in use by as many people as it is (for as long as it has), the product has not come close to meeting my expectations. Alexa confuses simple things that context should easily clarify. For example, \"the number of ounces in a gallon?\" is clearly a question of volume, and yet Alexa answers this in terms of mass- incorrectly, I might add. Music playing is predominantly all it is good for, and without a LOT of interaction and setup on my part, it fails spectacularly at that too. I should be able to say, \"do not play R&B music\" and have it understood that any music within this genre should be excluded from requests to play music. However, Alexa instead plays ONLY R&B music. Commands for volume control while available must be repeated 2-3 times to reach any meaningful adjustment. The list goes on and on. The fact that at this point in time, there is no connectivity or interaction with FireTV or FireStick is woefully unforgivable. Alexa's 'skills' require not only downloading, but invocation by 'name' at each use, and memorization of skill related commands/syntax- which makes them largely useless. Who can remember more than 2 or 3 of the myriad skills available for download? Her inability to answer simple questions that could simply be read from a search engine query is mind boggling. For being as good as it is at speech recognition, and for all the resources Amazon has presumably thrown at this, there is really no excuse for not being able to translate queries into reasonable answers any better than it does, other than really bad coding. Save your money, this device isn't remotely ready for prime time, and you are essentially paying to sign up to be a beta-tester. It's not much better at other vendors."},

I have tried everything to get it to play like it did when I first got it (2 weeks ago) and even talked to technical support at length and they couldn't understand why it is doing this or how to resolve it, so I am returning for a replacement.  If the replacement does this, I will be returning for a refund.  Can't keep messing with it. It's a lot of fun but when it stops working properly after 2 weeks, that's a problem.

In the future, there will likely be naive robots which can learn to do anything just by instructing it to download a task from the internet.  However, the biggest problem with echo lies in the software programming of it and the skills are too keyword driven. Once a skill is added to echo it should be smart enough to perform a function without using the exact keyword to initiate the skill. For example, once I download \"Can I Stream\" I should be able to ask Alexa \"Can I stream Prometheus\". But no, you must ask Alexa \"Ask can I stream can I stream Prometheus.\" Even though the skill has been added to Alexa one still has to open it with exact keywording before Alexa finds a brain. A lot more extensive software programming is needed to make this enjoyable versus aggravating. It would be nice to have some top of the line skills that cost $50 to $100 that perform more than rudimentary functions."},

Cute.  The problem I have with it is the functionality is extremely limited.  Siri - Apple - can usually respond to a much richer or more complex queries than Alexa can.  Also - the device is a bit self-centered. Example: Spotify on five devices around the house - Spotify connect is symmetrical - I can control on one device and listen on another.  If I ask Alexa to get involved, she immediately switches the listening device to be her....unfortunately the Sound quality of Alexa will never match a Yamaha 9 channel surround system so this is a bit funny...if not infuriating. The email connections are poor, as is calendar.  If I ask Alexa to connect to my outlook email account and read my email - no.  Or texts - no.  So I see the basis for a great personal assistant in the future, but we have a long way to go.  Hopefully Amazon doesn't make the mistake of only connecting Alexa to Amazon stuff....if so I will dump her.  The light ring is cute, and the voice recognition is extremely good...but again the functionality behind the recognition engine is very limited."},

I bought Alexa for an elderly person who relies on voice operated devices (as a result of inability to use their full faculties).alexa responds poorly to low voice commands but her she tends to switch off and does not respond well to installation of skills through voice commends.  if a person is relying on Alexa to the extent that's the person I bought Alexa for is relying,then this will be a deeply frustrating experience.alexa will have good utility for people using her for entertainment-but she is tempermental.i subsequently and at the same time as above,purchased an Alexa for myself and find that Alexa will tend to switch off if she does not know the answer to something.  She does not like to update her skills through voice commands and prefers if you log into the account.linking to Spotify and playing requested music is painfully slow.  Alexa is unable to be fully functional yet but as a device with great prospects I recommend her for the tech junkies.  I do not however recommend her for people who rely on voice command in need to entertainment or stimulation-she will not like your low voice and will prefer you log into your account to do something which means having to wait for someone else to do it for you."},

Unfortunately in the 2 weeks since it has arrived I have had several problems with it's performance.The biggest issue I have had is with Alexa responding to voice commands. I have tried to correct this by eliminating any noise in the room while speaking and even moving closer to speaker with the hope it will resolve the problem but unfortunately it did not. The second issue that I have been experiencing is with Alexa responding with \"loss of connection\" or I cannot answer that right now\" which is extremely frustrating. I have recently reset the device hoping it will correct some of these issues but the performance has not changed. When the Echo is working I really enjoy it but to have this many problems over a 2 week makes me second guess my purchase."},

I cant imagine how bad the dots will sound since they are smaller. The Alexa app is so amatureish and so generic. I hate that you have to say \"Alexa\" Everytime you want it to do something. Even immediately after telling it a command. This needs bigger sound. Maybe they should partner with Bose on the sound quality although doing that would price a lot of people out of buying it. It only comes directions to tell you to plug it in and download the joke of an Alexa app. Then the app tells you how to connect to your wifi. Other then that you either search the internet on how to use the features or call costumer service. If you are looking to buy this more more a music speaker dont be fooled by people's reviews on how great the sound is because its just ok. Im sad. Very sad for buying. \u2639\ufe0f"},

This speaker is quite loud for it's size, and I love that I can stream all of my music through it and request flash briefings. However, the claim that Alexa can hear you over the noise from the speaker is a complete lie. It has never worked for me. I had this set up in my home for only two weeks before it was completely unusable. I tried to start my day in the usual fashion by playing music and was answered by an obnoxiously loud white noise (kind of like the sound that came with \"snowy\" channels on old school T.V.'s). The sound would not stop until I completely unplugged the unit. Alexa would not respond to voice prompts while this noise was happening. I called Amazon support and they tried to troubleshoot the problem, but it seemed as though they had little to no idea what had caused this, and even less of an idea as to how we could fix it. Ultimately, they placed an order for a replacement unit. I am now waiting for the new unit to arrive, and have very low expectations for how long this thing will actually last. To me, this was a waste of money, and I would have been much better off ordering a bluetooth speaker."},

Now I understand hardware very well, but this degree of low reliability coupled with the fact that I spent 45 minutes today talking to three people (support, then Echo tech support and then a \"member of the leadership team\") to no avail tells me that Amazon has been, is and will continue to be a lousy hardware company.

It is advertised as \"revolutionary\", however that could not be farther from the truth. As advertised, the so called Alexa can add items to your shopping list, but if its faulty voice capturing system misreads your item whilst its selling your private conversations to the NSA and CCP, you cannot simply ask Alexa to revise the misinterpreted list, you must manually navigate the Alexa app to change this. The flaws with Alexa run deeper than this however, as it seems even Alexa itself has no idea what it's purpose is, let alone how to even accomplish the basic tasks programmed into it. Alexa's incompetence can be clearly defined when you delve deeper into the \"question asking interface\" now as some have noticed you can ask Alexa fun and quirky questions like \"who lives in a pineapple under the sea?\" And get a response saying \"spongebob square pants!\" Now while you're laughing and parting your husband Jim on the back for another quality anniversary gift, (12 years is your Alexa anniversary) you neglect to realize that this is the quintessential flaw with this glorified cylindrical Siri. To truly understand the disapointment behind this creation you must travel back to 2013 when Siri was first released, everyone was abuzz about the voice control and Siri's quirky sense of humor, however eventually everyone realized that \"wait this is useless\" and stopped using it. Flash forward half a decade later... And nothing has changed. Alexa has a lot on the surface but no substance other than that. You can get the same use out of Alexa that you could out of a pad of paper, the joke book you bought when you were best man at your pal dave's third wedding, and a calendar, or better yet, your Phone! I'm not going to extend this review longer than necessary, but I will end it with a simple example that illustrates everything Alexa is in its simplicity. When I asked Alexa what I assumed was a very simple question to test the depth of its knowlege it faltered and made me realize how useless it really is. I cleared my throat and said plainly, careful to enunciate every syllable, \"Alexa, who fought in the Spanish American war?\" Her answer: \"hmmm I don't know that one\""},

The man on the phone kept putting me on hold to look for ideas, and I tried the Amazon BSN network which the iphone deemed unsafe but nothing would finish the set up. The tech I was talking to disconnected me after over an hour. I looked up advice on the internet and followed those directions again with the same results.

I purchased it from a large, reputable electronics retailer in April 2016. Unfortunately, it quit working a month past the warranty. The Echo stopped responding one day (no lights, sounds or any kind of response). I worked through all of the recommended steps from unplugging the Echo, unplugging my router and modem and restarting everything to performing a factory reset and trying a new power adaptor. Nothing worked. I contacted Amazon about this. Amazon confirmed that my Echo no longer worked and I was offered a 15 percent discount on the purchase of a new Echo. After spending close to $200 on a product that lasted 13 months, this offer fell flat with me. I chose to write this review to warn others that the issue with my Echo (dying after a year) is a common issue. This is a great product, but the quality isn't there. If you purchase it, be sure to get the extra warranty coverage and factor that into the total cost of the purchase. Amazon needs to do a much better job of taking care of its loyal customers. This was a huge disappointment and definitely makes me think twice about ordering a larger ticket item from Amazon."},

After waiting 15 minutes online, I hung up.  This was bad enough, but I repeated this process on two more calls. Finally today, the tech called me; I was in a meeting and asked her to call back in 60 minutes. She agreed. But, then no one called. So I called service and again was placed on hold for 20 minutes before I hung up. Still worse, my problem has been reported multiple times on the web. It's clearly a problem with Echo - but Amazon wants to make me believe they never heard of this problem. This is so 1970. Jeff, stick to the delivery market. Can't wait for Apple to launch their product - it may cost more, but quality and service is top notch."},

I tried multiple adapters and the \"reset\" button, followed the troubleshooting procedure and to no avail. Then I called Amazon's support team to what I would expect to be a straightforward replacement situation where the device had a fault and had failed. 2 hours and 7 people later all they could offer was a slight discount on purchasing a new echo...I'm not impressed. I have always utilized Amazon and their devices. I was a devout and loyal customer, after this experience I am surely shaken. I would not recommend this product to anyone who feels they should get more than 1 year usage out of it, as should it fail. You will be out the money and if you want a discount on your failed device a few hours of your time and quite a few redundant conversations with incompetent support staff. Amazon, my far you have fallen in my eyes. Buy a different device from another brand such as the google home, way lower price and you get the same type of support...I paid more, because I expected more from Amazon. Lesson Learned."},

I only used it off and on as I ended up traveling considerably. So no regular use but sporadically over the last two years.  Looking back over my calendar, we're talking maybe 9 or 10 months of total use.  As of 2 months ago, the unit no longer worked.  I tried all the online suggestions - no success. Today I spoke with Amazon customer service who confirmed its defective, but as it's past the warranty date, they can only offer a 15% credit to purchase a new one.  Debating this now.  If the unit is only going to last a year of actual use, is it worth the $150 price tag? Likely not... Has anyone else had a similar experience with the Amazon Echo, or am I the unlucky one to have purchased a soon-to-be-defective product...?  Amazon tends to be great in their customer dealings, but in this case, I wish they'd replace the unit.  Warranty or not, these items should last much longer than this one did.  Has anyone here tried other companys' items? Any comparisons? Looking for advice.  Thanks!!"},

Performed like a star.  Since that time, the Alexa disconnects from wifi everytime I use it, within 5 minutes (or less) I have spent more time rebooting routers, extenders, Alexa herself (reset).  It simply won't stay connected to wifi.  What's WORSE is that she will respond to request to play or set alarms.  When I ask her to stop, she \"doesn't understand\" (disconnected) and will not stop the music or alarms.  I even unplugged her to stop and when I replugged, she continued to replay alarm.  My wifi works for every device in our home.  Laptops, tablets, phone, wifi speakers.  EVERYTHING but the Echo.  I'm a computer tech, and can't get this device to work consistently, much less for more than 1 command.  I've reconnected her at least 20 times today, trying everything.  I could call and spend the 3 hours on the phone just to repeat what I have tried, but basically fried on the product.  Reset to original did not improve anything.  This produce is severely flawed in my opinion and a rip off.  Took the plunge for 1/2 price on sale day.  Sorry I did.  My VAVA wifi speaker works great.  I wanted Echo for the music and that, in and of itself has not been successful.  I will never purchase these Amazon devices again, much less all of the additions and security devices.  I loved it while it worked for the short 1 week.  Sad product, sad response for those who have problems, sad reflection of Amazon in my opinion!"},

I was so excited to get it and immediately tried setting it up. It would not connect to the Wi-Fi after trying troubleshooting several different times and ways. I got on the chat with Amazon to try and solve the problem and they were surprisingly useless as well. They told me to move the Echo closer to the router, try restarting the router and Echo, and then said oh it's broken - I'll send a replacement. I JUST GOT IT. So frustrated, and really disappointed with Amazon during this process."},
