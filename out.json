The older model is a heavy, durable plastic and the noise level is perfect as white noise. This new model feels cheap, and it barely makes any sound. Level 3 on this one makes as much white noise as level 1 on the older model. I'm very disappointed in this change from Honeywell. There was a time when they made the perfect fan. I'm going to take my old one to an electrician to see if it can be fixed.

The \"whole room air circulation\" claim seems like a load of marketing fluff, but I suppose if you work out the airflow in your room and aim the fan precisely you can achieve such air circulation nirvana. For most consumers, though, I would imagine you just want this thing to blow cool air when you're sweating out hot summers, and this fan does a decent job. The way it pushes air is that it pushes it out in a wide angle, so if you just point the fan at you you're likely not going to feel as good a breeze if you just use this to try and push the hot air around you away, Unfortunately, like others have stated the build quality of this fan is pretty sketchy, as my fan broke off from the base very easily within a year of normal use. So even if you think you have the most gentile of touches, I recommend just finding the perfect spot for this fan and then rarely if ever trying to move it lest you want to accidentally break it off of the base."},

HA! The teeny-tiny screws are located in narrow deep wells, so I am going to have to find a long and very small phillips screwdriver. Or just replace the thing when it gets dirty, which is not an ideal solution. The angle of the fan is adjustable and clicks into fixed positions on the stand. So far, I have not managed to turn it on without pushing it through all the angle stops. You need two hands to hold it in place and another to turn on the switch. (I only have two.) I bet the plastic will wear out quickly. The knob is awkward to grip and the first speed is high, so if you want low or medium, you have to click it one or two more stops. That seems counterintuitive to me and like unnecessary wear. The fan does the job and the materials seem sturdy, but the design is a bit strange."},

I have been buying these fans since the late 90's because they were an excellent value with air flow at a low price, but the quality seems to have dropped over the years.  In comparison, I had a no-name brand fan that I bought for under $10 at Home Depot and it lasted over three years before it went.  This fan was it's replacement but just didn't last.

I read the reviews and understood some of the issues other people had and was not too concerned about it tipping over, noise, or airflow. I purchased this fan to put in the window above our bed to give us a direct breeze at night. I used stationary square fans before and have to prop them up at the rear to get them to blow air down onto the bed. We were really looking forward to this fan that we could stabilize in the window and blow air on us. PROBLEM... the fan only rotates upward not downward... this totally defeats the use we purchased it for. When I have time I will see if I can remove the molded in factory stops so it can rotate down and be used as I intended."},

Mounted next to bathroom window. Hoping swivel would allow directing fan out window (exhaust smells) and then towards shower (eliminate mold). Product arrived as described. Product does not have mounting hardware (I drilled holes in base and used own mounting screws/materials). Product only swivels  90 degrees. Since I needed more, I carefully bent/forced the swivel limit closer to 180 degrees. The plastic did not rupture or break but I'm sure it stressed under the force. I now can swivel almost 180 degrees and still seems stable. Fan does not seem as powerful as a smaller -similar style (UtiliTech) fan I have mounted next to a vent-less gas heater (air circulation). Fan is quiet (do to low power) and I estimate about half as loud as a ground-standing standard square box fan (but half the power). Fan is entirely plastic including hinges and base. Pooped and showered this morning and it exhausted the smells and dried the shower."},

It started making a weird chirping sound, which was quite annoying, so I turned it off, then later went to turn it back on and it won't come on at all. I expected it to last much longer than that. There is a 1 year \"limited\" warranty, but you have to pay shipping charges ($10!), which is not acceptable considering I did nothing to damage the fan and a new unit would only cost $15. So. Yeah. I'm very irritated and disappointed in the fan and in Honeywell in general. I will replace it with another brand."},

After two months of continuous use, there was a horrific oder in the baby's room that smelled like burning electrical wires.  After spending a few weeks performing various troubleshooting activities such as moving out the cloth diaper pail and replacing the electrical outlets in the room, I was convinced there was a dead animal frying in the wiring somewhere within the walls.  I decided to unplug everything in the room (again) and I finally pulled out the fan and noticed the motor itself was the source of a substantial electrical smell.  I plugged the fan into a small bathroom thinking maybe the outlet was to blame and sure enough within 5 minutes the bathroom had the same burning electrical smell.  I have no idea why the white version of the same fan has this problem, but the black fan has been back in the baby's room operating 24/7 with no problems for months."},

I then went to the amazon page and saw that that specific model was no longer being made but the upgrade, the HT-900 was the new replacement so without delay I went ahead and bought two October of last year. A little less than a month later the first fan gave out. I wrote to the company which was called Helen of Troy and they took their time in answering. After explaining what had happened they told me to return the fan through the  ail and they would replace it. When I got to the post office I was told that the shipping would cost just as much as buying a brand new fan. So either I could buy a new fan or mail them the bad one, wait a couple of weeks for them process it and then send me a new one which may or may not work.

The fan is great in the fact that for the size it moves a good amount of air and the newer models are pretty quiet even on full.  I have a bulldog that loves to go lay in front of the fan when she is hot so this is the perfect size to suit her needs and I generally leave it running most of the summer season.  With how much I like how well this fan performs the glaring issue I have with them is longevity.  I have been using this model of fan for years but the problem is I pretty much have to buy a new one every year.  As they age the fan does get louder and eventually wont have enough power to start spinning on its own but will start moving if you were to stick something through the grates and poke the blades.  I have a feeling if it were possible to take the front off and clean the blades it may last longer."},

It is slightly bigger than a standard soccer ball. it looks big, but its maximum wind speed does not match to its size. The kind of breeze that hits your face while travelling at 10-15 miles per hour in a car hits you at its maximum speed. I have seen even smaller fan with powerful motor giving better breeze than this fan. I can bet that a normal hair dryer can give you stronger breeze (if we ignore area). When I turned it ON, I was slightly disappointed, but I think in this price it is a decent deal. if you are sweating it can dry you in 15 to 20 mins. Best part is that you won't get headache or fall sick because of direct breeze on your face at this speed. It is quite silent because it is slow. Also, IT DOES NOT TURN 360 degree (just straight and top - 90 degree angle of rotation is allowed). I just bought it because honeywell is a trusted brand, and lot of people already bought it and have given good reviews. I hope it will accompany me for at least 2-3 years. Last, if you are thinking of buying it for your office desk, then I would suggest you to buy a smaller one. It will occupy lot of space on your desk and won't look good. Expectations about speed may vary from person to person; to me it is 10 to 20% slow, which is not a huge disappointment overall. Honeywell can make it perfect by improving speed little bit and increasing range of angle of tilt by -40 to 90 (currently it is 0 to 90) degrees."},

Sure it circulates the air, but when you think of a TurboForce Air Circulator you get the impression by the description that you will get a huge rush of air that will flap the curtains and blow papers everywhere. That will never happen with a blade 3.5 inches long from the tip of the blade to the hub nor will it create a huge force of air with the blade angles and the rpm in which the fan turns.

I was very disappointed, especially considering the price. I have a fan that I bought for 9.99 that is louder, and not as well made. It's a metal fan, but it generates much more air, and I usually keep it on medium because high is too strong. I needed another fan, and this got such great reviews. If you want a fan you are going to keep right on top of you, this is fine, on the highest speed. I think it's better to buy a fan in person where you can feel how much air it will blow. My son just walked by it for the first time, and put his hand in front of it. His comment was 'unacceptable'. That says it - in a nutshell."},

This tiny fan is a great bargain IF you live in a small apartment like I do. It works well at all speeds but it needs to be directed right at you, and at short distances only. Even the fastest speed hardly created any air movement when I moved 8 feet from the fan. As for circulating air, it's okay, but definitely not enough when it's a hot stifling day. I would recommend this in addition to another fan/AC in the room, or if you sleep with it pointed at you from a nearby desk. It does not oscillate, so do not expect it to circulate air too well.

I was reading someones review and he was talking about how it was good for circulating air. That may be true, as it doesnt seem very \"turbo\" at all, but strangely i did notice it blowing my curtains which were 10 feet away. However this fan does not make me nor the air in my apartment feel the slightest bit cooler. It blows warm air around. I tried putting it in front of my window ac unit, thinking it would pull that cool air and distribute it, nope. Did nothing. I tried putting nxt to my open window to help feel cool air, nothing. I tried it by itself, just on my counter 3 feet away, didnt feel the slightest bit cooler. Maybe theres some magical secret that everyone else knows about how to make this thing work good, because I sure as hell dont. Complete disappointment for me. I gotta return it and try something else."},

It's a metal fan, but it generates much more air, and I usually keep it on medium because high is too strong. I needed another fan, and this got such great reviews. If you want a fan you are going to keep right on top of you, this is fine, on the highest speed. I think it's better to buy a fan in person where you can feel how much air it will blow.

Even the fastest speed hardly created any air movement when I moved 8 feet from the fan. As for circulating air, it's okay, but definitely not enough when it's a hot stifling day. I would recommend this in addition to another fan/AC in the room, or if you sleep with it pointed at you from a nearby desk. It does not oscillate, so do not expect it to circulate air too well.

Much to my chagrin, when it arrived, it is apparent the fan is better suited to a desk or table than a floor. Also, the reason for the fan is my neighbor's bastard Pomeranian, whose incessant barking sounds someone scuffing their shoe on a wood floor over and over for hours on end (rent-control makes moving out less attractive).... Thus, the mighty box fan, and voila! cessation of migraine. This fan is nearly silent. Great product, no doubt! -- but not well suited to my purposes."},

I was reading someones review and he was talking about how it was good for circulating air. That may be true, as it doesnt seem very \"turbo\" at all, but strangely i did notice it blowing my curtains which were 10 feet away. However this fan does not make me nor the air in my apartment feel the slightest bit cooler. It blows warm air around. I tried putting it in front of my window ac unit, thinking it would pull that cool air and distribute it, nope. Did nothing. I tried putting nxt to my open window to help feel cool air, nothing. I tried it by itself, just on my counter 3 feet away, didnt feel the slightest bit cooler. Maybe theres some magical secret that everyone else knows about how to make this thing work good, because I sure as hell dont. Complete disappointment for me. I gotta return it and try something else."},
